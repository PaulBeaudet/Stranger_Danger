                <h1>About OurService</h1>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h4>Say what!?</h4>
                    <p>Our service looks to empower people to connect with strangers in a fast,
                        safe and convienient way, through timed text.
                        Sure, strangers are inherently strange, yet most of our best friends or
                        invaluble professional peers start off an strangers to us. Some of them
                        even remain strange long after becoming aquented! OurService acts a gateway
                        to creating a strong connection, providing a new shared context with
                        people of simiar interest.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Give me friends?</h4>
                    <p> It should be noted that OurService holds no promise of forcing anyone to be
                        your friend. OurService hopes to help create situations where any two users become
                        comfortable with each other enough that they want to continue the conversation
                        regularly IRL ( in real life ) or in more identifing contexts like other networks,
                        phone, or video chat.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                    <p>It realy easy to get started! Just type any topic that interest you at the
                        moment and ourService shows your topic to similar users or just whoever happens
                        to be on at the time. If the topic peaks someone interest they can select it
                        and WHAMIE BAM! They are in a real time conversation with you. Simple as that. Stop
                        talking to repeat the process, keep talking to potentially make a new friend.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Is OurService Anonomous?</h4>
                    <p> Short answer is yes, the long answer is NO.
                        Asking, anonmous to who? Makes this question more clear.
                        By default, no one needs to use an identy in order to use OurService besides paying to sign-up.
                        Effectively, given two users have never talked before they are in simple terms
                        anonomous to one another.
                        Once users get talking, our paying customers can label users they have had good conversations
                        with. The label basically favorites the person so that if they are on again our robots know to
                        prioritize making the match again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        OurService, does keep track of everyone by a unique ID and stores unique words
                        that they use in order to determine which other users might want to see their topics. OurService
                        strictly uses user data to provide value to the service and its parent companies. Please

                        Watching this ecosystem grow will be a unique experience.
                        Right now we imagine OurServices will be helpfull for

                        be good text conversationalist already. Who knows though, maybe people who rarely type

                    <h4>Unique situation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Beta and Lifetime users will share the unique context of being on the service first.
                        The first Beta users will be likely mostly be based in Southern NH because that
                        is where OurService is being developed.
                        Many people might already know each other or have a friend of a friend
                        in common on OurService but they will only ever find out by chatting.

                    <h4>Shape what happens</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are basic design rules to how OurSerice works, but ultimately our beta users are
                        really going to show where OurService can be valuable.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Beta goals</h4>
                    <p>
                      OurService is going to be a great resource for finding unique serendipidous interactions
                        Gaining the critical mass is important for this, but first we are going to have help
                        making sure the wrinkles are ironed out and we can handle influx of a lot of use. Beta
                        is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor and see the possibilities and have
                        the first interactions that lead to those possibilities.

                            Getting a business going is a rosey thing from the outside. It is easy to see all of

                            Creating a company that provides more value than it takes is something I have
                            worked at for a number of years. The only reason any of this can be possible is
                            the continuing suport of family, friends, future friends and living in a place
                            that celebrates the pursuit of dreams. Lifetime membership provides more than the value of
                            OurService for life, it reconizes that you are core believer
                            in the OurService team and myself"
