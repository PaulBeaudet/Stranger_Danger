        .col-lg-6
          h4 Say what!?
          p
            | Our service looks to empower people to connect with strangers in a fast,
            | safe and convienient way, through timed text.
            | Sure, strangers are inherently strange, yet most of our best friends or
            | invaluble professional peers start off an strangers to us. Some of them
            | even remain strange long after becoming aquented! OurService acts a gateway
            | to creating a strong connection, providing a new shared context with
            | people of simiar interest.
          h4 Give me friends?
          p
            | It should be noted that OurService holds no promise of forcing anyone to be
            | your friend. OurService hopes to help create situations where any two users become
            | comfortable with each other enough that they want to continue the conversation
            | regularly IRL ( in real life ) or in more identifing contexts like other networks,
            | phone, or video chat.
        .col-lg-6
          h4 How does it work?
          p
            | It realy easy to get started! Just type any topic that interest you at the
            | moment and ourService shows your topic to similar users or just whoever happens
            | to be on at the time. If the topic peaks someone interest they can select it
            | and WHAMIE BAM! They are in a real time conversation with you. Simple as that. Stop
            | talking to repeat the process, keep talking to potentially make a new friend.
          h4 Is OurService Anonomous?
          p
            | Short answer is yes, the long answer is NO.
            | Asking, anonmous to who? Makes this question more clear.
            | By default, no one needs to use an identy in order to use OurService besides paying to sign-up.
            | Effectively, given two users have never talked before they are in simple terms
            | anonomous to one another.
            | Once users get talking, our paying customers can label users they have had good conversations
            | with. The label basically favorites the person so that if they are on again our robots know to
            | prioritize making the match again.
          p
            | OurService, does keep track of everyone by a unique ID and stores unique words
            | that they use in order to determine which other users might want to see their topics. OurService
            | strictly uses user data to provide value to the service and its parent companies. Please
            | see our privacy policy for more details about how the data can and cannot be used.

            | is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor and see the possibilities and have
            | the first interactions that lead to those possibilities.
