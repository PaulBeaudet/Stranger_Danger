            | Our service looks to empower people to connect with strangers in a fast,
            | safe and convienient way, through timed text.
            | Sure, strangers are inherently strange, yet most of our best friends or
            | invaluble professional peers start off an strangers to us. Some of them
            | even remain strange long after becoming aquented! OurService acts a gateway
            | to creating a strong connection, providing a new shared context with
            | people of simiar interest.
          h4 Give me friends?
          p
            | It should be noted that OurService holds no promise of forcing anyone to be
            | your friend. OurService hopes to help create situations where any two users become
            | comfortable with each other enough that they want to continue the conversation
            | regularly in other contexts like social networks, messaging, or video chat.

          p
            | It is easy to get started! Just subscribe to any topic that interest you as they appear.
            | OurService matches your topics to similar users who happen to be online when you are.
            | Once the system makes a match there will be a countdown to talk with them. Simple as that. Stop
            | talking to repeat the process, keep talking to potentially make a new friend.
